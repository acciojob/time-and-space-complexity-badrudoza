	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity refers to the computational 
		efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the
		execution time scales with the size of the input. 
		An efficient algorithm is one that can process 
		large amounts of data quickly, often having a 
		lower time complexity than less efficient 
		algorithms. Measuring the time complexity helps 
		developers choose the most performant algorithm
		for a specific task. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> describes the amount of memory 
		an algorithm uses as a function of the input size.
		It's a crucial metric for evaluating the efficiency
		of algorithms, especially when memory resources are
		limited. Essentially, it quantifies the memory 
		space required by an algorithm to run until it 
		completes.

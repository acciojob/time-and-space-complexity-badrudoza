	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity refers to the computational 
		efficiency of an algorithm, indicating how the
		execution time scales with the size of the input. 
		An efficient algorithm is one that can process 
		large amounts of data quickly, often having a 
		lower time complexity than less efficient 
		algorithms. Measuring the time complexity helps 
		developers choose the most performant algorithm
		for a specific task. 
	</p>
	<p>
		<b>Space complexity</b> The analysis of an algorithm's
		memory usage is described by Space Complexity, which 
		indicates the amount of memory an algorithm requires 
		as a function of its input size. For example, if an 
		algorithm needs to store an array of size n, its Space 
		Complexity would be O(n), meaning the memory used grows
		linearly with the input size.
